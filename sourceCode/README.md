# UNTAMED Embedded Firmware

**Project UNTAMED** is an environmental and motion monitoring system developed by HardwareX Engineering for the "UNTAMED" https://untamed.team/ initiative. This firmware powers the UNTAMED system and orchestrates sensor sampling, data logging, real-time monitoring, and efficient wireless data uplinking ‚Äî optimized for embedded deployment in harsh and remote environments.

## üîã Battery Monitoring and SoC Estimation

The system reads the battery voltage using a calibrated voltage divider and compensates for ESP32-S3 ADC error. A curve-fitting method maps the measured voltage (after compensation) to real-world battery state-of-charge, based on empirical measurements using precision lab equipment. The system considers 3.60V as the minimum operating threshold.

## ‚è± Power Optimization

- Radios disabled when idle (`disableRadios()`)
- CPU frequency scaling supported via `setCpuFrequencyMhz()`
- ADC averaging with calibrated offset and slope correction
- Ultra-lightweight display refresh logic

---

## üìä Logging Format

Each log file is stored with the following format:
timestamp,type,data...
I: AccelX,AccelY,AccelZ,GyroX,GyroY,GyroZ,MagX,MagY,MagZ
G: Latitude,Longitude,Speed,Course
W: WindSpeed,WindDirection
T: ExternalTempC

Data is flushed every 2 minutes or when buffer is full. Logs are uploaded periodically via WiFi.
